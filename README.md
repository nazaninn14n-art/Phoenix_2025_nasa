  TerraQuest

TerraQuest is a hybrid scientificâ€“artistic platform that transforms 25 years of NASA Terra satellite data into an interactive, data-driven, and animated storytelling experience.
It bridges the gap between data science and human experience, turning raw environmental observations into tools for understanding, empathy, and action.

 Features

* Interactive Web Platform
  Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, designed for an intuitive and cinematic interface.

* Temporal Visualization of Terra Data

  * Over 9,000 Terra datasets processed.
  * Representative days: [15, 46, 74, 105, 135, 166, 196, 227, 258, 288, 319, 349].
  * Converted into aligned PNG map frames using Python.

* GIF & Timeline Animation

  * Flask backend (`asdfg.py`) generates GIFs for any year range.
  * JavaScript timeline controller enables smooth navigation through years.

* AI Chatbot Assistant

  * Backend (`chatbot.py`) powered by OpenAI.
  * Provides answers about Terra, its instruments, and environmental science.

* Machine Learning Classifier

  * (`app.py`) loads a trained rainfall classification model.
  * Flask interface for interactive predictions.

* AI Video Generation

  * (`2.py`) integrates Diffusion models (Zeroscope) for generating cinematic videos.
  * Converts user prompts into short analytical or narrative clips.

* Artistic Layer

  * Creative film with AI tools (Sora, Hailuo AI, ChatGPT).
  * Story of a water droplet witnessing drought and learning how satellite data protects Earth.

 Example Workflow

1. Explore historical Terra data through the interactive timeline.
2. Generate GIF animations of rainfall/temperature trends.
3. Use the chatbot to ask scientific questions.
4. Run the classifier to analyze rainfall conditions.
5. Create narrative videos to combine science with storytelling.
